# e-Sheba
e-Sheba is one of my fun projects. It is an Android App built with HTML, CSS, jQuery Mobile and Phone Gap.

# Description
This project is solely developed for the people residing in Bangladesh. Bangladesh government has facilitated us by enabling e-Services and took a big step in building Digital Bangladesh. But as a matter of fact more than 75% people are yet to discover these e-Services and opportunities to make life easier. Opportunity has no value if one cannot grab it, so we decided to build this app so that one can easily get access to the e-Services and use them if needed. This app is composed with all of the e-Services and forms those are provided by Government currently. In this era of small devices and tabs we believe almost everyone in Bangladesh will come to know and access these services.

# Developers
☛ Coding - Abdullah al Imran

☛ UI & Graphical Designing - Pahlwan Rabiul Islam & Arafat Wasiullah

# Note
This app is in beta version. The "News Feed" feature of this app is still not coded. We thought to provide live notices & newses of Bangladesh Government into this feature.
